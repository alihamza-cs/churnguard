# ChurnGuard — Explainable Customer Churn Prediction

Predict customer churn using machine learning and explain *why* customers are likely to leave.

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — building an end-to-end ML pipeline

## Goals
- Build a clean, reproducible machine learning pipeline
- Train and evaluate baseline and improved models
- Add explainability to support decision-making
- Demonstrate good software engineering practices

## Planned Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Git

## Roadmap
- [ ] Data ingestion & cleaning  
- [ ] Baseline model (logistic regression)  
- [ ] Model evaluation (ROC-AUC, F1)  
- [ ] Feature importance & explainability  
- [ ] Inference script
